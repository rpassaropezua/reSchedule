# Problem Statement
Most scheduling applications aim to make scheduling activities/services/due dates/etc... as easy as possible.
This is a goal I very much share with this project, however my main goal is to focus on ease of re-scheduling.
People cancel things often, and the process of re-scheduling can be very time consuming and expensive. If this process
could be streamlined, and maybe even automated, it could help small businesses become more stable.

# Project Plan
* Week 1-5
  * Build the structure of the app.
  * Figuring out what api's the application will need.
  * Figuring out what front end framework to use for the web app.
  * Filling out the database with an initial run of the project.
  
* Week 5-7
  * Getting all the api endpoints created, all routes set up.
  * Getting the login, register, and dashboard pages done on the front end.
  
* Week 8-9
  * If all api endpoints are created by now, implement each page necessary for the project.
  * Use postman to see how I would be communicating with the api and build the front end accordingly.
  * Hibernate integration, have the server perform actual functionality when the api calls it.
  
*  Week 10-16
  * Adding GoogleAuth.
  * Make the front end look nice.
  * As things seem necessary add new api routes (hopefully won't have to, but able to).
  * Add tables as deemed necessary by the app's requirements, this will become more clear as the front end app is closer to finished.
  * Hopefully dockerizing and hosting on aws ECS or at least deploying to aws EC2.
  * Pushing the MySql DB to aws RDS.
